## Analysis: Question 1 Plotting a cluster

### Question being asked 

_Provide in natural language a statement of what question you're trying to answer_

I'm trying to visualize the clusters in an intuitive, explainable way since UMAP is neither of thse things.

### Data Preparation

_Provide in natural language a description of the data you are using for this analysis_

Code taken from Amy

_Include a step-by-step description of how you prepare your data for analysis_

Split the shots into the 5 clusters so I can plot them seperately and load the neccesary data and images to make the half rink plots.

_If you're re-using dataframes prepared in another section, simply re-state what data you're using_

# Read the rink images and format them to a raster used for graphing
rink_raster <- makeRaster(filepath, 'Rink_Template.jpeg')
half_rink_raster <- makeRaster(filepath, 'Half_Rink_Template.jpeg')
```

### Analysis: Methods and results

_Describe in natural language a statement of the analysis you're trying to do_

I'm trying to plot each of the clusters with as many features visible as feasible on a half rink graph. The location of the graph allows for the angle and distance to the goal to be plotted, and I intend to utilize color and size as other dimensions. I have (mostly arbitrarily) chosen possesion time for the size dimension and handedness for the color dimension (because it was already in the code)

_Provide clearly commented analysis code; include code for tables and figures!_

```{r, result01_analysis}
# Include all analysis code, clearly commented
# If not possible, screen shots are acceptable. 
# If your contributions included things that are not done in an R-notebook, 
#   (e.g. researching, writing, and coding in Python), you still need to do 
#   this status notebook in R.  Describe what you did here and put any products 
#   that you created in github. If you are writing online documents (e.g. overleaf 
#   or google docs), you can include links to the documents in this notebook 
#   instead of actual text.

plotShots <- function(shots){
ShotType <- shots$shotOutcome
levels(ShotType) <- c('D','G','S','M')

#Going to try and display 
angle_means <- shots %>%
  #group_by(puckAngle<=90) %>% 
  summarise(mean(goalieAngle), mean(goalieDist)) %>% 
  set_names(c('meanAngle', 'meanDist')) %>% 
  # Data for graphing
  mutate(xstart = ysize / 2) %>% 
  mutate(ystart = pipes_x) %>% 
  mutate(radius = meanDist)

#Idea: do the arrows out of the goal for goalie angle and distance.
#For how to divide it: maybe goalie angle average for points on the left side and goalie angle average for points on the right side?
#Need to rescale the arrows

halfRinkGraph(shots) + 
  # Graph players colored by handedness
  geom_text(aes(label = ShotType,color = as.logical(rightHanded), x = shotStatX(shots), 
                 y = shotStatY(shots), size = posTime)) +
  scale_color_discrete('Handedness', type = c('red', 'blue'), labels = c('Left', 'Right')) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = 'Posession Time', range = c(3,9))+
  new_scale_color() +
  # Arrow pointing to average goalie angle
  # Length of arrow is average goalie distance
  geom_spoke(data = angle_means, aes(x = xstart, y = ystart, angle =
  torad(meanAngle), radius = radius), 
  key_glyph = 'abline', linetype = 'solid', arrow = arrow(), linewidth = 1) +
  #scale_color_discrete('Average angle', type = c('red', 'blue'), 
  #labels = c('Left', 'Right')) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

plotShots(cluster2)
plotShots(cluster3)
plotShots(cluster4)

# to show the raw numbers used in the creation of the image
#print(angle_means)
#plotShots(goals)

```

### Discussion of results

_Provide in natural language a clear discussion of your observations._

The rink plots provide a sense of the actual meaning of the data that the numbers lack, especially since the raw data units aren't intuitive. Here, we can see the defender blocks were simply too far away, the panic shots were on the left and had a high possesion time, the goals were snap shots from close in, most of the ones that had a good shot but failed were on the right, and basically all the traffic jam shots took place from within or next to the right circle.


## Analysis: Question 2 Graphing a singular point

### Question being asked 

_Provide in natural language a statement of what question you're trying to answer_

What is the best way to plot a single play on the rink?

### Data Preparation

_Provide in natural language a description of the data you are using for this analysis_

_Include a step-by-step description of how you prepare your data for analysis_

All the needed data preperation was done in the first question. I am reusing the half rink picture and the data frames containing the clusters.

_If you're re-using dataframes prepared in another section, simply re-state what data you're using_

```{r, result02_data}
# Include all data processing code (if necessary), clearly commented

```

### Analysis: Methods and Results  

_Describe in natural language a statement of the analysis you're trying to do_

I am plotting the individual play with the same feature mappings as I did for the clusters, but I am also including a dot for the location of the nearest defender and an arrow pointing to where the goalie is.

_Provide clearly commented analysis code; include code for tables and figures!_

```{r, result02_analysis}
# Include all analysis code, clearly commented
# If not possible, screen shots are acceptable. 
# If your contributions included things that are not done in an R-notebook, 
#   (e.g. researching, writing, and coding in Python), you still need to do

#   that you created in github. If you are writing online documents (e.g. overleaf 
#   or google docs), you can include links to the documents in this notebook 
#   instead of actual text.

#plotPoint <- function(shot){
shot <- shots_stats.df[101,]
  ShotType <- shot$shotOutcome
levels(ShotType) <- c('D','G','S','M')

#potential code for computing defender location
defPos <- cbind.data.frame(shotStatX(shot) + cos(torad(shot$defAngle))*shot$defDist,shotStatY(shot) + sin(torad(shot$defAngle))*shot$defDist) 
colnames(defPos) <- c('x','y')
 
#Calculates the goalie's position
angle <-  shot %>% mutate(xstart = ysize / 2) %>% 
  mutate(ystart = pipes_x) %>% 
  mutate(rad = goalieDist) %>%
  mutate(ang = goalieAngle)

  halfRinkGraph(shot) + 
  # Graph players colored by handedness
  geom_text(aes(label = ShotType,color = as.logical(rightHanded), x = shotStatX(shot), 
                 y = shotStatY(shot), size = posTime)) +
  scale_color_discrete('Handedness', type = c('red', 'blue'), labels = c('Left', 'Right')) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = 'Posession Time', limits = c(0,5))+
  new_scale_color() +
  # Arrow pointing to average goalie angle
  # Length of arrow is average goalie distance
  geom_spoke(data = angle, aes(x = xstart, y = ystart, angle =
  torad(ang), radius = rad), 
  key_glyph = 'abline', linetype = 'solid', arrow = arrow(), linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(data = defPos,aes(x = x,y=y,color = "Turquoise"))+
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)+
    scale_color_discrete('',type = c('turquoise'))
#}
#plotPoint(shots_stats.df[29,])

```

### Discussion of results

_Provide in natural language a clear discussion of your observations._

The main advantage of this is it does a good job of explaining why a shot had a particular outcome in a way that isn't as easy to see in the main graph. For example, the save here is obviously a save because the nearest defender wasn't in a position to block it, allowing it to get to the goal. The goalie was then able to stop it because she was facing the shooter and also had come out of the goalie box towards her.

## Analysis: Question 3 Producing an app

### Question being asked 

_Provide in natural language a statement of what question you're trying to answer_

I am trying to figure out the best way to display the data in a way that will allow useful insight to be made in the future

### Data Preparation

_Provide in natural language a description of the data you are using for this analysis_

_Include a step-by-step description of how you prepare your data for analysis_

_If you're re-using dataframes prepared in another section, simply re-state what data you're using_

```{r, result03_data}
# Include all data processing code (if necessary), clearly commented

```

### Analysis methods used  

_Describe in natural language a statement of the analysis you're trying to do_

_Provide clearly commented analysis code; include code for tables and figures!_

I am making an app that will allow plays to be plotted. I intend to add more features to allow users to customize data selection and plot features in the future. The link to the current version is at https://lp01.idea.rpi.edu/shiny/smithc22/Play_Plotter/ . I intend to add more features over the next few weeks. Note that the drop down is currently used for cluster selection, the checkboxes don't do anything. You can find the code for the app in the ShinyApps folder under Play_Plotter. Linked is a google doc that explains the app because R doesn't want to let me put screenshots in the notebook for some reason
